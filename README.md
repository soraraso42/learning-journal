###This will be a composite journal for all my learnings on computer science 
and related topics.
Initial entries will take form of individual issues.
Each issue will begin with a sequence code, simply denoting the order I started.
Tag with course names will help with later publication to GitHub Page,
but I will try adhere to MD formatting.

####000 is ccna certification course
####001 is CS61A
####002 is 60001
####003 is CS50
####004 is Data Analysis with Python certification

I will try NOT to juggle with more than three courses.

Some rudimentary mistakes will be recorded as to remind myself where I started.
There will also be 'tsukkomi',aka the smallest hill I will use my time on.
